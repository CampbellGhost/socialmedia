## Welcome to CheckMe
This documentation outlines the development process and key features of the social media clone website I created using HTML, CSS, and SCSS. The goal of this project was to enhance my development skills and gain practical experience in creating a user interface that replicates the design and functionality of a social media platform.

### Project Overview:
>
The project involves the creation of a social media clone, which imitates the look and feel of a popular social networking site. The main focus is on the front-end development, utilizing HTML for structuring the content and CSS/SCSS for styling and layout.

### Technologies Used:
>
1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): Used for creating the structure of the web pages, including headings, paragraphs, forms, and more.
2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Employed for styling the website's elements, such as fonts, colors, margins, and positioning.
3. SCSS (Sass CSS): Utilized as a more efficient and organized way of writing CSS code, providing features like variables, nesting, mixins and partials.

### Features Implemented:
1. Navigation Bar: Created a responsive navigation bar that provides links to various sections of the website.
User Profiles: Designed user profiles with profile pictures, cover images, and user information.
2. Posts: Developed a layout for posting content, including text, images, and links.
3. Likes & comments: Added a "like" feature to posts, allowing users to appreciate and acknowledge content.
4. Responsive Design: Ensured the website is accessible and visually appealing across different devices and screen sizes.


**Through this project, I gained valuable experience in HTML and CSS, honed my front-end development skills, and developed a better understanding of responsive design. I also learned to utilize SCSS to enhance the efficiency and organization of my code.**
